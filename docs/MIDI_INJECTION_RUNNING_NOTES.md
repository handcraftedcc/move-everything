# MIDI Injection Running Notes

Purpose: append-only notes for debugging `midi_to_move` injection stability in `src/move_anything_shim.c`.

## 2026-03-10

### Evidence observed
- Crash window showed mailbox occupancy spikes (`occ=3..5`, including slot 4) while injector activity continued.
- Crashes included assertion signal for event ordering and an additional assertion in `EventBuffer.hpp:233` (out-of-range event times).
- In external-injection mode, injector busy/interleave conditions were still causing queue drops.

### Change implemented
- External busy guard now blocks injection whenever the contiguous prefix is non-empty (`search_start > 0`), not only when 2+ slots are occupied.
- Busy return (`insert_rc == 2`) now defers queue processing to next cycle (keeps packet queued) instead of dequeueing/dropping.

### Tests
- Updated `tests/shadow/test_midi_to_move_injection_stability.sh` to assert:
  - guard condition is `search_start > 0`
  - busy path breaks/defer-retries
  - busy path does not advance `read_idx`
- Test result: PASS.

### Commit and deploy
- Commit: `835f51d` (`shim: defer midi injection when external mode sees busy prefix`)
- Branch pushed: `origin/MidiInTesting`
- Build/deploy artifact MD5: `5014374e4aaaa56066d3b2e5b6366dbd`
- Installed with: `./scripts/install.sh local --skip-confirmation --skip-modules`
